                <img src="images/computer.jpg" alt="" id="img1"><br><Br>
                <p> Computer is an electronic device that takes input, processes it according to given instructions,
                    stores the data, and gives output.
                    It can perform tasks like calculations, writing, drawing, playing videos, or connecting to the
                    internet.</p><br><br>
                <p>
                    <b> Basic Functions of a Computer:</b><br><br>
                    Input – Accepts data (e.g., from a keyboard, mouse, touchscreen).<br>
                    Processing – Uses a CPU (Central Processing Unit) to perform calculations and make decisions.<br>
                    Storage – Saves data temporarily (RAM) or permanently (hard drives, SSDs).<br>
                    Output – Shows results (e.g., on a monitor, speakers, printer).<br>
                    Control – Coordinates all the above activities.<br>
                </p>
            </div><br><br>

            <div id="Characteristics">
                <h1>Characteristics Of Computer</h1><br>
                <p><b> 1. Speed</b><br>
                    A computer can perform millions of operations in just one second.<br>
                    It works much faster than humans when it comes to calculations or processing data.<br><br>
                    <b> 2. Accuracy</b><br>
                    Computers are highly accurate.<br>
                    They rarely make mistakes unless there is an error in the program or data.<br><br>

                    <b> 3. Automation</b><br>
                    Once programmed, a computer can work automatically without user intervention until the task is
                    complete.<br><br>

                    <b> 4. Versatility</b><br>
                    A computer can perform different types of tasks—writing, drawing, playing music, calculations,
                    internet browsing, programming, and more.<br><br>

                    <b> 5. Diligence</b><br>
                    Unlike humans, computers don’t get tired or bored.<br>
                    They can work continuously for long hours without any drop in performance.<br><br>

                    <b>6. Storage</b><br>
                    Computers can store large amounts of data permanently and retrieve it whenever needed.
                    They can hold everything from documents and videos to entire databases.<br><br>

                    <b>7. Multitasking</b>
                    Computers can perform many tasks at the same time. For example, you can listen to music while
                    writing a document and downloading a file.<br><br>

                    <b> 8. Reliability</b><br>
                    Computers give consistent performance over time, making them very reliable for daily tasks and
                    complex operations.

            <div id="CPU">
                <h1>CPU-Central Processing Unit </h1><br><br>
                <img src="images/cpu.jpg" alt="CPU" id="img1"><br><br>
                <b> What is a CPU?</b><br>
                The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is a key hardware component in computers and many electronic devices.
                It processes instructions from programs, carrying out calculations and control operations.<br><br>

                How does a CPU work?<br>
                Fetch: The CPU gets (fetches) an instruction from the computer’s memory.

                Decode: It interprets what the instruction means.

                Execute: It performs the action—like calculating a number or moving data.

                Store: It saves the result back to memory or registers.

                This cycle repeats billions of times per second.<br><br>

                Components of a CPU<br>
                Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):<br>
                Performs mathematical operations (add, subtract, multiply) and logical operations (AND, OR, NOT).<br>

                Control Unit (CU):<br>
                Manages and directs the flow of data between the CPU, memory, and peripherals.<br>

                Registers:<br>
                Very fast, tiny storage locations inside the CPU holding data, instructions, or addresses temporarily
                during processing.<br>

                Cache:<br>
                Small but very fast memory close to the CPU cores to speed up access to frequently used data.<br><br>

                <b>CPU Characteristics</b><br>
                Clock Speed:<br>
                Measured in gigahertz (GHz), it determines how many instruction cycles the CPU can perform per
                second.<br>

                Cores:<br>
                Modern CPUs have multiple cores (dual-core, quad-core, etc.). Each core can process instructions
                independently, improving multitasking and performance.<br>

                Threads:<br>
                Some CPUs can handle multiple threads per core, which helps with running multiple tasks
                simultaneously.<br><br>

                <b> Types of CPUs</b><br>
                Desktop CPUs:<br>
                High-performance CPUs for personal computers.<br>

                Mobile CPUs:<br>
                Optimized for low power consumption in laptops, tablets, smartphones.<br>

                Server CPUs:<br>
                Designed for heavy workloads and reliability in data centers.<br><br>

                <b>Why is the CPU important?</b><br>
                Without the CPU, your device can’t run software or respond to commands. It’s the central hub that
                processes all your programs, from your operating system to games and apps.<br><br>

                It provides the foundation and infrastructure for applications to run.<br>

                Usually complex, often involves multiple interacting parts.<br><br>

                <b>Application (Application Software)</b><br><br>
                An application is a specific program designed to perform a particular task or group of tasks for the

                <b> Why is OS important?</b><br><br>
                Without an OS, you would have to communicate directly with the hardware, which is very complex.<br>

                It makes the computer easy to use and allows multiple programs to run smoothly.<br><br>

                <b> What is Computer Security?</b><br><br>
                It means protecting computers and data from being stolen, damaged, or accessed by unauthorized
                people.<br><br>

                <b>Common Threats</b><br>
                These include viruses, malware, phishing attacks (fake emails to steal info), and hackers trying to
                break into systems.<br><br>

                <b>How to Protect Yourself</b><br>
                Use strong passwords, keep your software updated, and avoid clicking suspicious links or downloading
                unknown files.<br><br>

                <b>Tools for Security</b><br>
                Firewalls block unwanted network traffic, antivirus software detects and removes harmful programs, and
                encryption keeps data private by coding it.<br><br>

                <b>Importance of Backup and Recovery</b><br>
                Regularly saving copies of your data helps you restore it if something goes wrong, like a cyberattack or
                hardware failure.<br><br>
